    "# 1 - Load data and prepare text\n",
    "The first step in this analysis is to load the data in with iglob, and clean the tweets to lemmatize, change words to lowercase, and remove stopwords in order to cluster the data most accurately. Because the amount of tweets (62,000) is so large, the cleaning function and clustering can take an extremely long time. One option to  this time taken is to multiprocess the cleaning portion of the tweets by either pooling them, or creating a managed list in the multiprocessing package. Another option is to take a sample of the tweets for analysis. The latter was chosen for this project."

    "The last step in the analysis is to look into what kind of clustering took place of the tweets. We once again take a sample of the 5,000 tweets to see if we can find a general understanding for how the clusters were done. From above, it can be seen there are still potential flaws with the clustering. For example cluster 6 has almost now relation between the examples, but US is found multiple times, suggesting either that cluster is focused on the US location and it potentially would've been beneficial to remove additional stopwords."
